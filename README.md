# Real time eye state classification
Developed a window based application which can play videos and can pause them automatically when a user is not looking at screen. The input for this application will be a video captured from webcam of user’s computer.
In this application, while user is watching a video, in background software captures video through webcam and detects user’s face and eye continuously. When it detects face and eye, the video frame is sent for further processing. At this stage, K-means clustering is applied to determine where user is looking and if for several continuous frames user is not looking at screen, video is paused.
The project is developed using C# and Visual C++ using OpenCV library. Viola Jones algorithm is used to detect face and eye. K-means clustering is used to determine direction where user is looking.
